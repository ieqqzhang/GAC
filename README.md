# GAC
This is our Tensorflow implementation for our Knowledge-Based Systems 2022 paper and a part of baselines:

>Qi Zhang, Bin Wu, Zhongchuan Sun, Yangdong Ye*(2022).

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* tensorflow == 1.14.0
* numpy == 1.16.4
* scipy == 1.3.1
* pandas == 0.17

## C++ evaluator
We have implemented C++ code to output metrics during and after training, which is much more efficient than python evaluator. It needs to be compiled first using the following command. 
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
If the compilation is successful, the evaluator of cpp implementation will be called automatically.
Otherwise, the evaluator of python implementation will be called.
NOTE: The cpp implementation is much faster than python.**
